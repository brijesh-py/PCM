Stoichiometry is a branch of chemistry that deals with the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves using balanced chemical equations to determine the quantitative relationships between the amounts of substances involved. Here are the key concepts related to stoichiometry:

# Key Concepts in Stoichiometry:

1. **Balanced Chemical Equations:**
   - Before applying stoichiometry, ensure that the chemical equation is balanced. This means that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation.

2. **Mole Concept:**
   - The mole is a fundamental unit in chemistry, representing Avogadro's number of entities (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.). One mole of any substance contains approximately \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) entities (Avogadro's number).

3. **Molar Mass:**
   - The molar mass of a substance is the mass of one mole of that substance. It is expressed in grams per mole (g/mol). To calculate the molar mass, sum the atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule.

4. **Mole-to-Mole Relationships:**
   - In a balanced chemical equation, the coefficients represent the mole-to-mole relationships between reactants and products. Use these coefficients to convert between moles of one substance to moles of another.

5. **Mass-to-Mole and Mole-to-Mass Conversions:**
   - Use the molar mass to convert between the mass of a substance and the number of moles. The formula for these conversions is:
     \[ \text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} \]
     \[ \text{mass} = \text{moles} \times \text{molar mass} \]

6. **Limiting Reactant:**
   - The limiting reactant is the reactant that is completely consumed in a chemical reaction, limiting the amount of product formed. Calculations involving limiting reactants are essential in stoichiometry.

7. **Theoretical and Actual Yield:**
   - The theoretical yield is the maximum amount of product that can be formed based on stoichiometric calculations. The actual yield is the amount obtained experimentally. The percent yield is the ratio of actual yield to theoretical yield, expressed as a percentage.

8. **Percent Composition:**
   - The percent composition of a compound is the percentage by mass of each element in the compound. It is calculated using the formula:
     \[ \text{Percent Composition} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of Element}}{\text{Molar Mass of Compound}} \right) \times 100\% \]

### Example Stoichiometry Problem:

Let's consider the reaction between hydrogen gas (H₂) and oxygen gas (O₂) to form water (H₂O).

\[ 2\text{H}_2(g) + \text{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \]

If you have 4 moles of hydrogen gas, how many moles of water can be produced?

1. Identify the coefficients in the balanced equation: \(2\text{H}_2 : \text{O}_2 : 2\text{H}_2\text{O}\).
2. Use the mole-to-mole relationship to convert moles of hydrogen gas to moles of water: \(\text{moles of H}_2 \times \frac{2\text{ moles H}_2\text{O}}{2\text{ moles H}_2} = 4\text{ moles H}_2\text{O}\).

Stoichiometry is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions. Regular practice with stoichiometric problems will help solidify your understanding of these concepts.
