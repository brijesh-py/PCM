Chemical bonding is the process by which atoms combine to form molecules or compounds. The interaction between electrons in the outermost energy levels of atoms is crucial for understanding chemical bonding. Here are the main types of chemical bonds:

### 1. **Ionic Bonding:**
   - **Formation:** Ionic bonds form between a metal and a non-metal.
   - **Process:** One atom donates electrons (cation, positive charge), and another atom accepts electrons (anion, negative charge).
   - **Example:** Sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) combine to form sodium chloride (NaCl).

### 2. **Covalent Bonding:**
   - **Formation:** Covalent bonds form between non-metal atoms.
   - **Process:** Atoms share electrons to achieve a more stable electron configuration.
   - **Examples:** Hydrogen (H₂), oxygen (O₂), and methane (CH₄) are examples of molecules formed by covalent bonds.

### 3. **Polar and Nonpolar Covalent Bonds:**
   - **Polar Covalent Bond:** Electrons are shared unevenly between atoms, creating a dipole moment.
   - **Nonpolar Covalent Bond:** Electrons are shared equally between atoms.
   - **Example:** In HCl, the shared electrons spend more time around chlorine, creating a polar bond.

### 4. **Metallic Bonding:**
   - **Formation:** Metallic bonds form between metal atoms.
   - **Process:** Electrons are shared among a "sea" of metal atoms, allowing for electrical conductivity and malleability.
   - **Example:** Copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) exhibit metallic bonding.

### 5. **Hydrogen Bonding:**
   - **Formation:** Hydrogen bonding occurs when hydrogen is bonded to a highly electronegative atom (usually oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine).
   - **Process:** The partially positive hydrogen atom attracts the partially negative region of another molecule.
   - **Example:** Water (H₂O) exhibits hydrogen bonding between its hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

### 6. **Van der Waals Forces:**
   - **Formation:** These are weak intermolecular forces that arise due to temporary fluctuations in electron distribution.
   - **Types:** Includes London dispersion forces and dipole-dipole interactions.
   - **Example:** Noble gases like helium (He) exhibit weak Van der Waals forces.

### 7. **Coordinate Covalent Bond:**
   - **Formation:** A type of covalent bond where both shared electrons come from one of the atoms.
   - **Example:** Formation of ammonium ion (NH₄⁺) involves a coordinate covalent bond.

### 8. **Resonance Structures:**
   - **Definition:** Molecules or ions with the same arrangement of atoms but different arrangements of electrons.
   - **Example:** Ozone (O₃) has resonance structures due to the delocalization of electrons.

### 9. **Ionic vs. Covalent Character:**
   - **Ionic Character:** Represents the degree to which electrons are transferred in an ionic bond.
   - **Covalent Character:** Represents the degree to which electrons are shared in a covalent bond.

### 10. **Lewis Structures:**
    - **Representation:** Lewis structures are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms of a molecule and the lone pairs of electrons that may exist in the molecule.

### 11. **Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR):**
    - **Concept:** VSEPR theory predicts the molecular geometry of molecules based on minimizing the repulsion between electron pairs around a central atom.

Understanding these different types of chemical bonds is essential for comprehending the properties and behaviors of various substances in chemistry. Bonding influences the structure, reactivity, and physical properties of molecules and compounds.
