Differential equations are equations that involve one or more derivatives of an unknown function. They play a crucial role in describing various physical, biological, and economic phenomena. Differential equations are classified into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs) based on whether they involve one or more independent variables.
