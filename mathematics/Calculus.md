Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of rates of change and accumulation of quantities. It has two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus.

1. **Differential Calculus:**
   - **Limits and Continuity:** The foundation of calculus, understanding how functions behave as the input approaches a certain value.
   - **Derivatives:** Measures the rate at which a function changes. It provides information about the slope of a curve at a given point.
   - **Rules of Differentiation:** Formulas for finding derivatives of various functions, including power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule.
   - **Applications of Derivatives:** Using derivatives to analyze motion, optimization problems, and related rates.

2. **Integral Calculus:**
   - **Antiderivatives:** Finding the reverse process of differentiation. An antiderivative of a function is a function whose derivative is the original function.
   - **Definite Integrals:** Calculating the accumulated quantity between two points. It represents the area under a curve.
   - **Integration Techniques:** Methods for finding integrals, including substitution, integration by parts, partial fractions, and trigonometric integrals.
   - **Applications of Integrals:** Solving problems related to areas, volumes, and other physical quantities.

3. **Multivariable Calculus:**
   - **Partial Derivatives:** Extending the concept of derivatives to functions of multiple variables.
   - **Multiple Integrals:** Integrating functions of multiple variables over regions in space.
   - **Vector Calculus:** Studying vector fields, line integrals, surface integrals, and the theorems of Green, Stokes, and Gauss.

4. **Differential Equations:**
   - **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):** Equations involving derivatives with respect to a single variable.
   - **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):** Equations involving partial derivatives, often used to describe physical phenomena.

Calculus plays a crucial role in various fields such as physics, engineering, economics, computer science, and biology. It provides a powerful framework for understanding and modeling dynamic processes and is an essential tool for advanced studies in many scientific disciplines.
